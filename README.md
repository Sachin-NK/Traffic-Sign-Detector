# Traffic Sign Detection using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify traffic signs. It is designed as a prototype for car dash cams and currently supports processing **pre-recorded video files**. The output video highlights detected traffic signs and displays labels or warnings.

## Features
- Traffic sign detection from video files.
- Saves the labeled output for further analysis.
- Modular scripts for training the model and running inference.

## Planned Enhancements
- Real-time traffic sign detection using live video streams.
- Improved performance and detection accuracy.
